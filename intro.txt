Intro

Dart is 90 percent javascript or java
What is programming?
PC a dumb machine.Obedient Master - Only follows given instruction. >binary - 1 0
We cant write , binary, so we use programming language to communicate to computer.
Computer - get code from humans, compile(compiler) and convert to languange that PC can understand

**************************************************

IDE - compile time fast
Android Studio - heavy
Visual Code 

dart is used as backend language for flutter apps
We make cross , hybrid applications, multi platforms apps, write single code and application for diffrent platforms is made easily including ioS, android, desktop, web, etc

For online coding - google introduces "Dart Pad" software
dartpad.dev
disadvantage - loose code


**************************************************

dart - installation

google > flutter download for windows/ioS

> Get the flutter SDK
This will also install dart
zip file will download : 1-2 GB
extract zip
extract files > c > new folder > extract
cmd > environment variables
System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables > User Variables and System Variables
System variables > Path > Edit > New > (copy flutter/bin address) > paste > ok
cmd > flutter doctor > not recognised, but env variable is added > restart and see again

cmd > dart --version

**************************************************

VS code > download > install

File > Preference > Extensions > Dart

Part-10
Dart String data type with examples
https://youtu.be/itjZmEKCyaM 
Part-11
Dart boolean data type with examples
https://youtu.be/CDItfMkxzSc
Part-12
Var data type(a unique data type)
This data type checks itself and decides its data type during runtime based on the initial value we will store into this. If we store an integer itâ€™s data type will be int if we store double its data type will be double and for list it will be list. 
Part-12 Var Data Type || Dart Programming Tutorials in Hindi/Urdu
