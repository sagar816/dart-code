  // in this lecture we will learn about variable
  // how to declare variable

  int number; //this is declaration, can only store integer values
  number =
      50; //this is initialization - storing values - single equalto operator

  int numberTwo;

  numberTwo = 40;
  numberTwo = -10; //values changed of variable


//add two integers number and store in third variable
  int result;
  result = number + numberTwo;

  print(number);
  print(numberTwo);
  print(result);
