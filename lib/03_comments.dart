  after the code is run it is compiled, 
  after that it is executed on the machine
  now computer does not know "hello", it understands binary
  Now in dart backend there is a compilation process,
  Now dart takes all this source code, compiles it, and converts it into computer language that is binary
  Compilation process starts at main() and executes serially
  Compilation process very complex, various regular expressions are used. Automata theory subject teaches that.

  In that in backend , whereever dart gets // , it knows, dont print it, it is comment, dont compile it
